INSTALLATION
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Copy Files

Copy all files to their equivalent directories in your eshop install.  If you're already using
your own custom theme, theme changes will have to be merged manually one way or the other (ie. merge
v6c_azure into your custom theme folder or vice-versa).  If you've made any changes to admin tpl files
in your eshop you may also need to merge some files under out\admin\tpl\.


2. CONFIG.INC.PHP Changes

Enable region (state/province) specific tax by appending the following to the config.inc.php file.  Change
according to your needs (for example, replace provinces with states).  Note that multiple taxes can be
defined for each region and each tax is assigned a label.

    /**
     * V6C addition to support tax calculations in NAShop extension.
     */
    $this->aRegionTax = array(  'AB' => array('GST' => 5), 		// GST
                                'BC' => array('HST' => 12), 	// HST
                                'MB' => array('GST' => 5), 		// GST
                                'NB' => array('HST' => 13), 	// HST
                                'NL' => array('HST' => 13), 	// HST
    							'NT' => array('GST' => 5), 		// GST
    							'NS' => array('HST' => 15), 	// HST
    							'NU' => array('GST' => 5), 		// GST
    							'ON' => array('HST' => 13), 	// HST
        						// PE & QC are special in that the advertised PST rate is taxed ontop of GST costs.
    							// As a result, if PST is applicable, an effective PST rate must be calc'd as follows:
    							// PSTeffective = PST*(1 + GST/100)
    							'PE' => array('GST' => 5), 		// GST
    							'QC' => array('TPS' => 5, 'TVQ' => 8.5*(1 + 5/100)),
    							'SK' => array('GST' => 5), 		// GST
    							'YT' => array('GST' => 5)  		// GST
                               );

Below is summary of changes/fixes made to adapt the shop to North American standards.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Hard-coding of currency sign outside of currency formating removed.  Currency sign now included into
  currency formating function.  Extended/modified files include: oxlang.php, oxrssfeed.php, oxutils.php,
  oxmdvariant.php, and many .tpl files.

- Removed asterix character (*) from prices that acted as a note about taxes being included.

- Costs determined from address & payment page only shown on order page (removed from basket page).
  Included removal of shipping, payment, and tax costs from basket page.

- Changed naming and layout of user addresses.

- Config option added to omit all tax calculations on prices displayed in shop and apply tax only to
  the final checkout price (v6c_naprice.php).

- Sort state/province abbreviations in user address forms (v6c_nacountry.php)

- Allow different and multiple tax values to be assigned to different states/provinces (v6c_nataxselector.php).
  Currently, requires mods to config.inc.php file.

- Recalculation of completed and paid orders in the back-end is disabled for multiple reasons:
	1. The shipping or payment method selected by the customer may not be available to the admin, making it
	   impossible to recalculate using same customer selections or impossible to obtain same shipping/payment
	   costs after making other changes to the order.
	2. Recalculation was occurring inadvertently (such as when updating the tracking code) and possibly changing
	   order totals when they should not be changed.
	3. There is not point having the ability to change the dollar amount of a completed order is there is no
	   mechanism to add/track multiple payments for a single order for the sake of collecting outstanding
	   balances.
  If you'd like to reverse the above changes, simply do not extend order_main with v6c_admin_naordermain and
  do not include changes to order_article.tpl, order_main.tpl, order_overview.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Notes to consider regarding changed functionality of the eShop.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- If the NAShop config option NAtax is set to ON/enabled, taxes involving multiple values will be calculated
  individually, as is the ideal case.  If NAtax is OFF/disabled, tax will be calculated from the cumulative
  percentage.  Note that, due to rounding, these may result in different order totals!  This is due to the
  following difference:
  		NAtax=ON: 	GROSS = NET + Round(NET*(TAX1/100)) + Round(NET*(TAX2/100))
  		NAtax=OFF:	GROSS = NET + Round(NET*(TAX1+TAX2)/100)
  Ideally, the calculation method used for NAtax=ON would always be used, but this would require some major
  code changes.  This is due to oxvatselector::getUserVat returning a double value throughout the code while
  proper support for multiple taxes would require an array to be returned.

- When prices do not include taxes (NAtax=ON), the order total will tax everything in order including
  shipping and payment method charges.  However, if including taxes in prices is desired (NAtax=OFF),
  auxilliary charges (shipping, payment, wrapping) will have taxes included INTO (not in addition to) their
  existing prices by default.  That is, by default, the costs for auxiliary charges do NOT change whether
  tax is on or off so you may want/need to adjust them manually according to the desired result.  Note,
  however, that this default behaviour can be changed only for shipping charges with the admin setting Core
  Settings>Settings>VAT: Enter Shipping Costs as net Price (plus VAT).
