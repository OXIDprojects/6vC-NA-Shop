2. CONFIG.INC.PHP Changes

Enable region (state/province) specific tax by appending the following to the config.inc.php file.  Change
according to your needs (for example, replace provinces with states).  Note that multiple taxes can be
defined for each region and each tax is assigned a label.

    /**
     * V6C addition to support tax calculations in NAShop extension.
     */
    $this->aRegionTax = array(  'AB' => array('GST' => 5), 		// GST
                                'BC' => array('HST' => 12), 	// HST
                                'MB' => array('GST' => 5), 		// GST
                                'NB' => array('HST' => 13), 	// HST

        						// PE & QC are special in that the advertised PST rate is taxed ontop of GST costs.
    							// As a result, if PST is applicable, an effective PST rate must be calc'd as follows:
    							// PSTeffective = PST*(1 + GST/100)
    							'PE' => array('GST' => 5), 		// GST
    							'QC' => array('TPS' => 5, 'TVQ' => 8.5*(1 + 5/100)),

Below is summary of changes/fixes made to adapt the shop to North American standards.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Config option added that will omit all tax calculations on prices displayed in shop and apply tax only to
  the final checkout price (v6c_naprice.php).  Enabling this option essentially enables the NA-Tax method.

- Hard-coding of currency sign in templates removed.  Currency sign now included into
  currency formating function.  Additionally, a config option is provided to change the position of the
  currency sign from trailing (right-side) to leading (left-side).

- Removed asterix character (*) from prices that acted as a note about taxes being included.

- Variable costs determined from address & payment options only shown on order page (removed from basket page).

- Changed layout of user addresses.

- Sort state/province abbreviations in user address forms (v6c_nacountry.php)

- Allow different and multiple tax values to be assigned to different states/provinces (v6c_nataxselector.php).
  Currently, requires mods to config.inc.php file.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Notes to consider regarding changed functionality of the eShop.
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- If the NAShop config option NA-Tax is set to ON/enabled, taxes involving multiple values will be calculated
  individually, as is the ideal case.  If NA-Tax is OFF/disabled, tax will be calculated from the cumulative
  percentage.  Note that, due to rounding, these may result in different order totals!  This is due to the
  following difference:
  		NA-Tax=ON: 	GROSS = NET + Round(NET*(TAX1/100)) + Round(NET*(TAX2/100))
  		NA-Tax=OFF:	GROSS = NET + Round(NET*(TAX1+TAX2)/100)
  Ideally, the calculation method used for NA-Tax=ON would always be used, but this would require some major
  code changes.  This is due to oxvatselector::getUserVat returning a double value throughout the code while
  proper support for multiple taxes would require an array to be returned.
